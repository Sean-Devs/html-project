    <h2>Autobiography</h2>
    <h1>Why I chose Information Technology</h1>
        <hr>
    <p>
        My interest in computers began in our family’s computer shop. 
        I wasn’t just a customer who used the machines—I was the one taking care of them. 
        From making sure the computers were running smoothly to fixing problems whenever they appeared,
        I slowly learned how each part worked. At first, it was challenging,
        but every time I solved an issue—whether it was a software error, a slow connection, 
        or a hardware problem—I felt proud. The shop became my training ground, and through those responsibilities,
        I developed not only my technical skills but also my patience and determination.<br>
        <br>As I grew older, my passion was further fueled by the people around me, especially my cousins.
        Many of them pursued careers in the IT industry and became successful in their respective fields.
        They would share stories about their projects, their challenges, 
        and the satisfaction they felt whenever they solved problems through technology. 
        Seeing their growth inspired me to follow the same path. 
        Their encouragement gave me the confidence to believe that I too could thrive in this field if I worked hard and stayed committed.<br>
        <br>Another strong influence came from social media. 
        Platforms like TikTok introduced me to people who made learning IT exciting and relatable.
        Among them, Gazi stood out the most. She is a Computer Science major, and through her content, 
        she didn’t just teach—she inspired.
        Seeing her passion and dedication to her field motivated me to work harder toward my own goals.
        Watching her videos, along with those of other IT professionals online, 
        made me realize how vast and dynamic this industry is. 
        Social media became a source of both knowledge and encouragement, 
        showing me that IT isn’t just a career—it’s a community where creativity, innovation, and growth never stop.
